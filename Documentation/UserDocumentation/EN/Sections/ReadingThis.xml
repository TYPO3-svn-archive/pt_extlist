  <title>Reading this documentation</title>
  <para>The intention of this document is to give the user an overview of the pt_extlist extension. Its target groups are TYPO3 integrators, administrators and developers. There are individual sections for each of those groups and sections that contain information for all of them.</para>
  <para>If you do not know what pt_extlist is doing, &quot;What does it do?&quot; is the chapter you should start reading. If you want to set up a first list with pt_extlist and do not know how to do that, &quot;Examples&quot; is the place to start.</para>
  <para>The TypoScript reference gives you a detailed explanation of all TS settings you can use for pt_extlist.</para>
  <para>This document was written by the developers of the second version of pt_list, Daniel Lienert and Michael Knoll. Thanks to Fabrizio Branca for the many brilliant ideas he had with pt_list version 1.0 and his steady support.</para>
